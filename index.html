            <h2>Who am I ?</h2>
                <p>Hello there and welcome to my profile. My name is Sudarshan Gurung and I am currently an Assistant Store Manager at BP working full-time.
                <br> However, a couple of months ago I discovered the joys of coding by making small projects with HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
                <br>I am now looking to continue my coding journey through Founders and Coders and understand what it takes, to become a Full Stack Developer.

            <h2> Why am I applying ?</h2>
                <p> As an individual with a passion for technology, I have always been curious about the possibilities that the tech industry presents. 
                Despite initially thinking that a career in tech was only reserved for the brightest minds, I've been inspired by success stories of people transitioning from mundane jobs to fulfilling roles as software developers. 
              This realization has motivated me to pursue a career in tech and become a software developer myself. Though the journey may seem challenging, I am eager to commit and prove that these stories can be true.<br>
                
                <br>
                After researching different programs, I am excited to apply to this software Foundation opportunity with FAC. 
                I feel  that the program has a logically laid-out curriculum that I believe will help me develop the necessary skills required to become a successful software developer.
                I am eager to join a community of like-minded individuals and grow my skills to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry.
                </p>
